Welcome to the Bifrost SMP community!

We’re a gaming community with a focus on Minecraft, but occasionally play other games such as Gartic Phone, Jackbox, or other games that our players have an interest in.

Our Minecraft server has a vanilla-like feel to it, with a few quality-of-life plugins and datapacks that don’t alter the gameplay experience too significantly. A full list of our plugins and datapacks, as well as server specs will soon be available on the website!

If you’re interested in joining our Minecraft server, please head over to │rules, make sure you’ve read through them, and type “/apply” in the channel. We have a short application process that should take about five minutes to complete. Once a staff member has accepted your application, you’ll be added to the server’s whitelist and given the ip.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to open a ticket in │questions, and a member of our staff team will respond as soon as possible.

Our website is bifrostsmp.com!
