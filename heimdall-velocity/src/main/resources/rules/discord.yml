## DISCORD RULES ##
## rules syntax is fairly straight forward.  The main things to be aware of are you cannot use tabs.  Only spaces are accepted for yml documents.  The format below is a simple double space indention so that each nested item is two additional spaces 'indented' to the item above it.  See below for an example.
## rules:
##   1:
##     -
##       name: "[whatever you want to name it]"
##       details:  #this is a nested group of rule details, each number following this represents a new line like a rule bullet point
##         1:  #this represents a bullet point for this rule
